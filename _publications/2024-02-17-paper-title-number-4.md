### Abstract
This paper investigates the multidimensional linkages among geopolitical risk (GPR), policy uncertainty (EPU), oil prices (WTI), and global stock markets (S&P 500 and RTSI) under the impact of the Russo-Ukrainian War (2021–2023). Using **wavelet coherence (WTC)** analysis, we explore both short- and long-term co-movements across the time-frequency domain. The results reveal strong synchronization patterns and directional causality among financial and energy variables, illustrating a **closed feedback loop** between local geopolitical instability and global economic volatility.

### Methodology
We apply **Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)** and **Cross Wavelet Transform (XWT)** to quantify dynamic correlations and lead-lag relationships between the variables. The squared wavelet coherence \(R^2(p,q)\) serves as a localized correlation coefficient (0–1) across time and scale.  
Monte Carlo simulations define the 5% significance contour. Arrow directions indicate causal flow:  
→ positive correlation, ← negative correlation, ↗ variable X leads Y, ↘ variable Y leads X.  
This approach allows us to distinguish **scale-specific dependencies** invisible to traditional VAR or Granger models.

### Results
- **S&P500–GPR:** high-frequency coherence post-war indicates stock markets amplify geopolitical shocks.  
- **Oil–S&P500:** strong bidirectional dependence; oil prices lead equity markets in early conflict phases.  
- **EPU–GPR:** alternating short- and mid-term coherence shows mutual reinforcement between policy and geopolitical risk.  
- **RTSI–Oil:** energy markets react immediately to Russian market fluctuations; long-term feedback through global energy channels.  
- **EPU–Oil:** policy uncertainty initially lags oil volatility but dominates in the later phase.

### Discussion
Findings demonstrate a **closed cyclical mechanism**:  
> War → ↑GPR → ↑EPU → ↓Stock Markets → ↑Oil Prices → ↑GPR.  

This feedback loop highlights how geopolitical tensions propagate through financial and energy systems, offering a robust empirical framework for assessing cross-market contagion in crisis periods.
