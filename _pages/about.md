## About Me
I am **Rongsheng (Royce) Zhang**, an undergraduate at **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign** double-majoring in **Mathematics and Statistics** with a minor in **Computer Science and Data Science**.

My research interests lie at the intersection of mathematical statistics and computer science: centered on optimization and machine learning, I focus on robust modeling and inference for high-dimensional and time-series data. Key areas include wavelet/multiscale structure discovery and sparse representation, robust estimation and risk measurement in financial econometrics, uncertainty quantification and causal inference in biostatistics, and policy evaluation and sample complexity in reinforcement learning within the MDP framework. Simultaneously, I develop verifiable evaluation and calibration methods addressing measurement error and sample complexity. My goal is to underpin scalable computation and reliable decision-making with rigorous statistical theory.
