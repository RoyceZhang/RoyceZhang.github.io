## About Me
I am **Rongsheng (Royce) Zhang**, an undergraduate at **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign** double-majoring in **Mathematics and Statistics** with a minor in **Computer Science**.

My research interests lie at the intersection of mathematical statistics and computing. Guided by optimization and machine learning, I develop robust modeling and inference for high-dimensional and time-series data. Core directions include wavelet/multi-scale structure discovery and sparse representations; robust estimation and risk measurement in econometrics; uncertainty quantification and causal inference in biostatistics; and policy evaluation and sample-complexity analysis for reinforcement learning in the MDP framework. I also study verifiable evaluation and calibration from the perspectives of measurement error and sample complexity. My goal is to pair rigorous statistical theory with scalable optimization to enable reliable decision-making.
