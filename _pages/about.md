## 🧑‍🎓 About Me
I am **Rongsheng (Royce) Zhang**, an undergraduate at **UIUC** double-majoring in **Mathematics** and **Statistics** with a **minor in Computer Science**. I work at the intersection of optimization, machine learning, and statistical modeling, with applications in medical imaging and finance.

## 🔬 Research Interests
My research interests lie at the intersection of **mathematical statistics** and **computing**. Guided by optimization and machine learning, I develop **robust modeling and inference for high-dimensional and time-series data**. Core directions include **wavelet/multi-scale structure discovery and sparse representations**; **robust estimation and risk measurement in econometrics**; **uncertainty quantification and causal inference in biostatistics**; and **policy evaluation and sample-complexity analysis for reinforcement learning in the MDP framework**. I also study **verifiable evaluation and calibration** from the perspectives of measurement error and sample complexity. My goal is to pair **rigorous statistical theory** with **scalable optimization** to enable reliable decision-making.
